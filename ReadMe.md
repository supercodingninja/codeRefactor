// Repository Description //
I am learning that some of the more difficult and common tasks for  both, front-end and junior developers, are to refactor existing code.  When I say "refactor," this is to improve the code (codebase) provided, without changing what it does; or meeting a certain set of standards, or implementing new technology.  A practice I adopted, and I believe is a common courtesy to bestow unto others, is when one party working with another party's code, incorporate "The Scout Rule."  The Scout Rule is really a recommendation, stating to always leave the code given to you to refactor, cleaner than when you found it. "CLEAN UP SOMEONE ELSE'S MESS,"  You may/maynot be thinking; but that is not the way that I suggest you think.  A good way you can impress your clients is going the extra mile:  improve any/all codebase(s) for long-term sustainability, etc.; i. e. ensure all links are functioning, correctly.  Have you ever considered reworking the CSS: to make it more efficient (you could do achieve this by consolidating CSS selectors and properties).  Does your codebase, which you refactor, follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements?  Have you ever considered including comments before each element/section of the page?  If you can refactor code, and everyone should be able to extend courtesy for their fellow person/temmate/client; then you are on your way to a successful career: so long as you keep learning, and applying what you learn.  In this repository, I will mimic what it's like to have a marketing agency hire our firm; and ask us to refactor their existing site- IT'S ALREADY ESTABLISHED- they just need us to make it more accessible. 

As developers, we Must make web accessibility an important consideration for businesses we develop for.  By doing so, it will ensure that all people (disable or not) can access a website: because anyone not able to access a site, is another potential customer loss, revenue not gain; and not to mention litigation that can occur when people, who have with disabilities, cannot access a website the business hired YOU to develop/refactor (#FACT).  Plus, the more accessible sites are better positioned in search engines (Bing, Google, Yahoo!, Baidu, Yandex, Ask.com, and DuckDuckGo are only  a few).  Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is everything and every bit of a necessary survival element EVERY business  or organization needs- it's vital; so it is with an assessible website.  Just as some people may/may not wear glasses to read, some people use assistive technologies (video captions, screen readers, braille keyboards, etc.) in their day to to day operations.  When you, the developer, make a website more accessible, you not only enable an organization to succeed, you enable the user, who needs a site to have certain functions, the ability to operate as their fellow person; which makes them feel like a complete person, not forgotten or less valued.  Remember this, as a developer, your goal should be designing experiences that makes people's lives simple; because as developers, we solve problems that people didn't even knew they had, even better, in a way that they did not understand: We are the super heroes and heriones of tomorrow; so get coding, and I hope this repository helps you along your development. - Frederick Thomas, Super Coding Ninja

// User Story //
Let's visualize ourselves as the marketing agency that hired our firm:
1.   We want our codebase to follow current accessibility standards.
2.   We want our codebase to be an optimumal level, to where our site best optimized, is reached by most, if not all search engines.

Let's visualize ourselves as a parties, who are disabled:
1.   We need the site to be keyboard friendly.
2.   We need all the content, not just some of the content, to be easily and readily accessible.
3.   We need alternative text available.
4.   We need clear contrast between the colors of the elements, of a website; since everyone's spectrum perception is different.
5.   We need headers structuring the content of a website; and they have to be done so, correctly.
6.   We need the form fields to be clearly labeled.
7.   We need only tabular data to be simple, not complex.
8.   We need to be able to adjust the text or font size; and the website does not break/render itself useless (especially from our original purpose).
9.   We need to be able to choose whether we desire automatic navigation or media.
10. We need the contents of a website to be clearly, descriptive, flow easily; and unique headers and links, etc.

Let's visualize ourselves, DEVELOPERS:
1.   We need to ensure all links all function, correctly.
2.   We need to ensure all CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
3.   We need to ensure the .css file is properly commented; especially since we are already simplifying the workflow/folder(s) directories structure.
4.   We need to ensure the website's url is still deployable.  [Can we deploy our reposotitory url live].
5.   We need to ensure our refactored code loads with no errors.
6.   We need to enhance the codebase, not utterly change the code without permission: it's good to keep the original codebase given, in another location; and copy that file, prior to refactoring the codebase.  Let's resemble at least 90% of the demo file provided (relative path: codeBase2Refactor/Assets/demo.png).
7.   We need to follow best practices for file structure, and naming conventions.
8.   We need to follow best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

// Developers: For GitHub Repository Purposes //
1.   It's a good idea to make sure you have a unique name for your repositiory.
2.   It's advised that your repositroy contains multiple descriptive commit messages (this is how you and other developers can track why you/others were committing any changes made: creates more time for action, and less thought on researching prior work- move forward, not backwards).
3.   It's highly suggested that your repository contains a quality README file (with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

// Refactored Codebase Goal(s) Accomplished/What is the Mocked Marketing Client's Acceptance Criterea for our Refactored Code Suggested //
We will know our refactor codebase is most likely to be accpeted by our Mocked Marketing Agency Client if:
1.   Our webpage meets accessibility standards.
2.   Other Developers can see semantic HTML elements, when viewing the source code.
3.   When other Developers view the structure of the HTML elements, they will then find elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
4.   When other Developers view the image elements, they will find accessible alt attributes.
5.   When other Developers view the heading attributes, they will find that they fall in sequential order.
6.   When other Developers view the title element, they will find a concised and descriptive title.
